Integration Tests
-----------------

This is a DocTest file, using the Python doctest format.

In an integration test, here's some of the globals you have to work with::

    >>> portal
    <PloneSite at /plone>

    >>> portal_name
    'plone'

    >>> folder
    <ATFolder at /plone/Members/test_user_1_>

    >>> user_name
    'test_user_1_'

    >>> user_password
    'secret'

    >>> user_role
    'test_role_1_'

    >>> app.REQUEST
    <HTTPRequest, URL=http://nohost>

    >>> app
    <Application at >

uwosh.double_blind_review integration testing.  I have chosen to implement all
the tests as doctests in order to provide some explanation of the functionality.

TODO:  Things that could use testing but are less critical:  backward
transitions, complete set of permissions for site managers and managers under
each state (presently only those critical to the double blind workflow functions
are tested).

NOTE:  The overide templates for history and byline views must
be tested manually in the user interface, since they could potentially be 
overridden by some other product that is installed.

This product installs a folderish object loaded with instructions at the root 
level of the portal which is only available to those with roles of "Site 
Administrator" or "Manager".  Check that the permissions  and workflow state
are correct.::
    >>> user = portal.acl_users._doAddUser('manager', 'secret', ['Manager'], [])
    >>> self.login('manager')    
    >>> root_content = portal.contentIds()
    >>> 'double-blind-review-instructions' in root_content
    True

    >>> from Products.CMFCore.utils import _checkPermission as checkPerm
    >>> from Products.CMFCore.permissions import AccessContentsInformation
    >>> instructions = portal['double-blind-review-instructions']
    >>> user = portal.acl_users._doAddUser('member', 'secret', ['Member'], [])
    >>> self.login('member')
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,instructions)

Good, generic users cannot access this information.  Now check that managers can.::
    >>> user = portal.acl_users._doAddUser('manager', 'secret', ['Manager'], [])
    >>> self.login('manager')
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,instructions)
    1

    >>> user = portal.acl_users._doAddUser('site manager', 'secret', ['Site Administrator'], [])
    >>> self.login('site manager')
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,instructions)
    1

The product adds two special roles that are used to control access to proposals
at different times: 1) 'submitter' anybody with this role can submit a proposal
(usually assigned to the Faculty group on my Campus); 2) 'Panelist' is a special
form of reviewer, used to allow access by the final decision panel to proposals
and reviews when they are in the 'panel_review' state.  Check that these exist,
since workflow behavior depends on these roles.::
    >>> roles = portal.acl_users.portal_role_manager.valid_roles()
    >>> 'Submitter' in roles
    True
    >>> 'Panelist' in roles
    True
    
Now check that the Dexterity type 'proposal_drop_box' has been defined and
the workflow 'proposal_folder_workflow'exists.::
    >>> workflows = portal.portal_workflow.listWorkflows()
    >>> 'proposal_folder_workflow' in workflows
    True
   
    >>> 'proposal_drop_box' in portal.portal_types
    True
    
Now iterate through all the roles on the portal and make sure that only 'manager'
and 'site manager' can create one of these drop boxes.::
    >>> from Products.CMFCore.exceptions import AccessControl_Unauthorized

    >>> for role in roles:
    ...    if role != 'manager'and role !='site manager' :
    ...        user = portal.acl_users._doAddUser('user', 'secret', [role], [])
    ...        # we are looking for a different result for managers.
    ...        self.login('user')
    ...        self.assertRaises(AccessControl_Unauthorized,portal.invokeFactory,'proposal_drop_box', 'test-drop-box')

Now check our managers::
    >>> self.login('manager')
    >>> portal.invokeFactory('proposal_drop_box', 'test-manager-drop-box')
    'test-manager-drop-box'
    
    >>> self.login('site manager')
    >>> portal.invokeFactory('proposal_drop_box', 'test-site-manager-drop-box')
    'test-site-manager-drop-box'
    
Convert a drop box that should have been created in the 'private' state
to 'open' (accepting submissions).::
    >>> working_drop = portal['test-site-manager-drop-box']
    >>> 'private' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(working_drop, 'review_state')
    True
    
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(working_drop, 'open')
    >>> 'open' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(working_drop, 'review_state')
    True

Now check that the Dexterity type 'mock_proposal' has been defined and
the workflow 'proposal_workflow'exists.::
    >>> 'proposal_workflow' in workflows
    True
   
    >>> 'mock_proposal' in portal.portal_types
    True
    
Now we can test that members can add a proposal, but only submit if they also 
have the role of 'submitter'.  I'm going to be careful and make two new users
for this test.::
    >>> user = portal.acl_users._doAddUser('student1', 'secret', ['Member'], [])
    >>> user = portal.acl_users._doAddUser('faculty1', 'secret', ['Submitter'], [])
    >>> self.login('student1')
    >>> working_drop.invokeFactory('mock_proposal', 'proposal1')
    'proposal1'
    
    >>> proposal1 = working_drop['proposal1']
    >>> 'private' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True
    
Now verify that the Members cannot submit.::
    >>> from Products.CMFCore.WorkflowCore import WorkflowException
    >>> self.assertRaises(WorkflowException,portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor, proposal1, 'submit')
    
However they can "send to Advisor/Mentor for review and submission".::
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(proposal1, 'to_advisor_review')
    >>> 'advisor_review' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True

Even after sending it to the mentor changes are possible.  Test adding ID 
information which is only visible to administrators, owners and editors 
(advisors/mentors).  First check if the proper types and workflows are available.::
    >>> 'proposer' in portal.portal_types
    True
    
    >>> 'mentor' in portal.portal_types
    True
    
    >>> 'id_info_workflow' in workflows
    True
    
Add proposer and mentor information.::
    >>> proposal1.invokeFactory('proposer','test-proposer')
    'test-proposer'
    
    >>> proposal1.invokeFactory('mentor','test-mentor')
    'test-mentor'
    
Verify their review states.::    
    >>> proposerinfo = proposal1['test-proposer']
    >>> 'private' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposerinfo,'review_state')
    True
    
    >>> mentorinfo = proposal1['test-mentor']
    >>> 'private' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(mentorinfo, 'review_state')
    True
    
Check that the permissions are correct.::
    >>> from Products.CMFCore.permissions import View   
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposerinfo)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(View, mentorinfo)
    1
    
    >>> self.login('member')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposerinfo)
    >>> checkPerm(View, mentorinfo)
    
    >>> self.login('manager')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposerinfo)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(View, mentorinfo)
    1
    
    >>> self.login('site manager')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposerinfo)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(View, mentorinfo)
    1

The advisor/mentor will usually be granted the local role of editor for the
proposal, but anybody with editor access on the site can also
access the proposal. Test this.::
    >>> user = portal.acl_users._doAddUser('editor', 'secret', ['Editor'], [])
    >>> self.login('editor')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposerinfo)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(View, mentorinfo)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    1
    
Now, give faculty1 the local role of Editor for proposal1 and check that the
permissions are correct.::
    >>> proposal1.manage_addLocalRoles('faculty1',['Editor'])
    >>> self.login('faculty1')
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, proposal1)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, proposerinfo)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, mentorinfo)
    1
    
After editting they submit the proposal.::
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(proposal1, 'submit')
    >>> 'submitted' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True
    
    >>> 'private' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposerinfo,'review_state')
    True

    >>> 'private' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(mentorinfo, 'review_state')
    True
    
Check Permissions.::
    >>> self.login('member')
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, proposerinfo)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, mentorinfo)
    
    >>> self.login('student1')
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, proposal1)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, proposerinfo)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, mentorinfo)
    1

Once submitted they can no longer modify it.::    
    >>> from Products.CMFCore.permissions import ModifyPortalContent   
    >>> checkPerm(ModifyPortalContent, proposal1)
    
    >>> self.login('faculty1')
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, proposal1)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, proposerinfo)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, mentorinfo)
    1
    
Nor should they have permission to delegate (and thus see) reviewer assignments.
They do have permission to delegate roles so that they can see the status bar.::
    >>> from plone.app.workflow.permissions import DelegateRoles
    >>> from plone.app.workflow.permissions import DelegateReviewerRole
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateReviewerRole,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)
    1
   
    >>> self.login('manager')
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, proposal1)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, proposerinfo)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, mentorinfo)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateReviewerRole,proposal1)
    1
    
    >>> self.login('site manager')
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, proposal1)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, proposerinfo)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation, mentorinfo)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateReviewerRole,proposal1)
    1

When the proposal submission deadline is reached the site manager (or manager)
should close the proposal drop box.::
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(working_drop, 'close')
    >>> 'closed' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(working_drop, 'review_state')
    True
    
It should not be possible for a proposer to create a new proposal in a closed 
drop box.::
    >>> self.login('student1')
    >>> from Products.CMFCore.permissions import AddPortalContent
    >>> checkPerm(AddPortalContent, working_drop)

The site manager (or manager) can now assign reviewers using local roles.::
    >>> user = portal.acl_users._doAddUser('reviewer1', 'secret', ['Member'], [])
    >>> proposal1.manage_addLocalRoles('reviewer1',['Reviewer'])
    >>> self.login('reviewer1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    
Once reviewer(s) is(are) assigned the site manager (or manager) transitions the
proposal to "under_review" status.  Normally this would probably be done to all
proposals within a proposal drop box at the same time by transitioning the drop
box and checking the "apply to contents" choice in the advanced options.:: 
    >>> self.login('site manager')
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(working_drop, 'to_under_review')
    >>> 'under_review' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(working_drop, 'review_state')
    True
    
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(proposal1, 'to_under_review')
    >>> 'under_review' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True
        
    >>> self.login('reviewer1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposerinfo)
    >>> checkPerm(View, mentorinfo)
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    1
    
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    1

The reviewer can create a review inside the proposal.  First check that such a
beast and the appropriate workflow exists.::
    >>> 'mock_review' in portal.portal_types
    True
    
    >>> 'anonymous_peer_review_workflow' in workflows
    True
    
    >>> proposal1.invokeFactory('mock_review','test-review')
    'test-review'
    
    >>> review1 = proposal1['test-review']
    >>> 'private' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(review1, 'review_state')
    True
    
Now check that the permissions are such that the proposers cannot see their own
proposal once it is in the review process.  This is to avoid proposers seeing
tentative decisions or incomplete reviews.::
    >>> self.login('student1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(View,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> self.login('faculty1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(View,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    
When the reviewer finishes the review they submit it.  The reviewer should no
longer be able to change it and the proposers should still not be able to see
it.::
    >>> self.login('reviewer1')
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(review1, 'submit')
    >>> 'submitted' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(review1, 'review_state')
    True
    
    >>> checkPerm(ModifyPortalContent, review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    1
    
    >>> self.login('student1')
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View,review1)
    >>> self.login('faculty1')
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View,review1)
    
Just to be careful.  Make sure random logged in users cannot see it either.::
    >>> self.login('member')
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    
When all the reviews are done the site manager (or manager) changes the proposal
and its contents to the under_panel_review state.  Normally this would probably
be done by transitioning the folder for all proposals of the same kind and 
checking the "apply to contents" choice in the advanced options.::
    >>> self.login('site manager')
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(working_drop, 'to_panel_review')
    >>> 'panel_review' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(working_drop, 'review_state')
    True
    
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(proposal1, 'to_panel_review')
    >>> 'panel_review' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True
    
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(review1, 'to_panel_review')
    >>> 'panel_review' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(review1, 'review_state')
    True
    
In this state only panelists and site managers (or managers) should be able to
see proposals and reviews. Note that panelists cannot see anything with an
ID_info workflow unless the managers explicitely share it with them.::
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)
    1

    >>> user = portal.acl_users._doAddUser('panelist1', 'secret', ['Panelist'], [])
    >>> self.login('panelist1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)
    1

    >>> self.login('student1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)
    
    >>> self.login('faculty1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)

    
    >>> self.login('reviewer1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)
    
When a decision is made by the panel the site manager (or manager) sets the
proposal and its contents to a state corresponding to the decision.  There are
two versions of each of these:  an invisible state that can only be seen by the
managers and panelists and a visible version that is visible to proposers and
reviewers as well.
    >>> self.login('site manager')
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(proposal1, 'to_denied_invisible')
    >>> 'denied_invisible' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True    
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)
    1

    >>> self.login('student1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)
    
    >>> self.login('faculty1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)

    
    >>> self.login('reviewer1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)
    
    >>> self.login('site manager')
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(proposal1, 'to_approved_invisible')
    >>> 'approved_invisible' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True    
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)
    1

    >>> self.login('student1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)
    
    >>> self.login('faculty1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)

    
    >>> self.login('reviewer1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)
    
    >>> self.login('site manager')
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(proposal1, 'to_alternate_invisible')
    >>> 'alternate_invisible' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True    
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)
    1

    >>> self.login('student1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)
    
    >>> self.login('faculty1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)

    
    >>> self.login('reviewer1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)

Lots of possible transitions to check.::
    >>> self.login('site manager')
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(proposal1, 'to_denied_invisible')
    >>> 'denied_invisible' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True 
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(proposal1, 'to_alternate_invisible')
    >>> 'alternate_invisible' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(proposal1, 'to_approved_invisible')
    >>> 'approved_invisible' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(proposal1, 'to_panel_review')
    >>> 'panel_review' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(proposal1, 'to_alternate_invisible')
    >>> 'alternate_invisible' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(proposal1, 'to_panel_review')
    >>> 'panel_review' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(proposal1, 'to_approved_invisible')
    >>> 'approved_invisible' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True
    
When the whole proposal drop box is converted to cycle_complete the proposals
should automatically convert to a visible state (this done by
make_decisions_visible.py in the product).  Need to check conversion and
permissions for both the proposal and reviews.::
    >>> portal.portal_workflow.doActionFor(working_drop, 'to_cycle_complete')
    >>> 'cycle_complete' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(working_drop, 'review_state')
    True
    >>> 'approved' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(proposal1, 'review_state')
    True
    >>> 'cycle_complete' == portal.portal_workflow.getInfoFor(review1, 'review_state')
    True
    
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)
    1

    >>> self.login('student1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,proposal1)
    >>> checkPerm(AccessContentsInformation,review1)
    >>> checkPerm(View, review1)
    1
    >>> checkPerm(DelegateRoles,proposal1)
    1
    >>> self.login('faculty1')
    >>> checkPerm(View, proposal1)
    1
